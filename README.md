Course Questions:

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this particular project the work that was done included creating a Q-training algorithm to solve the treasure hunt game and then change variables to determine the optimal values that would bring the results required in the least amount of runs. All other code segments were given and used as reference in creating the Q-training Algorithm.
